# Seed

Millions of students graduate high school every year with limited financial literacy and little understanding of the various methods of revenue the financial industry has to offer. Seed, a subscriptional app, offers the opportunity for high schoolers to dive into branching fields of managing their personal finance. Users complete 10-minute lessons everyday to learn about topics such as managing credit, economic structure, and stock market investing. Users then apply this knowledge to simulators and the real-world to gain authentic experience. A unique aspect of Seed is that it takes up a focus on teaching the new generation how to manage their financial portfolio with social impact. Our goal is to simplify and gamify complex financial concepts for high school audiences. Seed offers a mix between learning, application, and shaping their own values to propel our generation towards financial literacy.
